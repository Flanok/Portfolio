                    <h3>Development</h3>
                    <p>I have currently done a majority of back end development in 
                        my career but would like to transition to front end, and have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
                        I am working on becoming professional with React.

                    <h3>Eye for detail</h3>
                    <p>I have an attention for detail and am very thorough in the work that I do. I am analytical by nature 
                        and this has served me well in the workplace. It has often helped me to catch problems that others have missed.

                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>I have always had an interest in design. I have studied color theory and I enjoy 
                        arranging colors that look good together. I am intrigued by the psychological ways 
                        our brains perceive and respond to colors and shapes. The way you use them on a web 
                        page or an app is what makes a first impression on the consumer, and I understand the importance of this.

            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>I am someone who gives their best effort in everything that I do. I believe that you get out of life what you put into it 
                    and I apply this to my family, my work, and my hobbies. I try to teach my kids to do this as well. 
                    I currently have four boys ages 6, 5, 3, and 1. They are wild and wonderful, and I am so grateful to be able to raise them 
                    with my sweet wife by my side as my partner. </p>
                <p>In my spare time I enjoy doing activities with my family, 3D printing, drawing, woodworking, and playing musical instruments. 
                    I also enjoy playing games and putting together puzzles. Programming is a lot like a puzzle to me and it is always so 
                    satisfying when all the pieces are put into place perfectly, and the project works as it should. I am always looking 
                    for a new challenge and I am excited to see what I can accomplish next.</p>
